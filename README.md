# ALLECS: A Lightweight Language Error Correction System
ALLECS consists of two modules, web-interface and gec-api. We suggest deploying the gec-api on a GPU-powered server and the web-interface on a CPU-focused server. However, both modules can be deployed on the same server. Refer to the instruction in each module for installation.
